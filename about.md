TODO: what do we actually want to feature here? only fangames and hacks or should other things like
comics, fanfics, art, music etc. also be featured? 

## Submitting your own project

You have your own PMD-related project you want featured on PMDCollab? Awesome, we'd like to here more about it!
Please join the [SkyTemple Discord server](https://discord.gg/4e3X36f) and discuss your project with us.
Note that we only accept projects that are reasonably far in the development process, ideas and early works
will not be featured here (although we'd love to hear about them as well on Discord).
